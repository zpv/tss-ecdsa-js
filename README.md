JavaScript SDK for [KZen-networks/multi-party-ecdsa](https://github.com/KZen-networks/multi-party-ecdsa), a Rust implementation of {t,n}-threshold ECDSA (elliptic curve digital signature algorithm).

Includes full threshold access structure, including network and threshold HD keys.

## Protocol

This library implements [[Gennaro, Goldfeder 20](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540.pdf)]'s protocol for threshold ECDSA.
